            As a person I am very curious, enthusiastic, love taking long walks
            in the forests, maybe enjoy a nice coffee and freshly baked
            pasteries.
          </span>

          <span>
           Along of other things I do is cooking, gaming and working on my novel.
          </span>
          <span>
          I am also very fascinated by art and how you can create things and illustrate out of your mind, itâ€™s a beautiful thing.
          </span>

          <span>
          That is why I have taken an interest and have began self tutoring myself 
          within Graphic Design and Motion Design.
